Command-line arguments: [options] [input file(s)]

The system writes output files with the same name as the input file, except
with '.knownagents' extension. (This will replace an existing '.useragents'
extension if present, otherwise will be appended.)

Input options
-------------

-stdin
  Read data from stdin instead of files. (Implies -stdout.)

-test selftest
  Tests that the internal user-agent list is internally consistent.

-- 
  Indicate that this is the end of the options section (required if the first 
  input file starts with a -).

@{file}
  Read arguments from a file instead of the command line. You can combine
  this usage with command-line options. Using a file is highly recommended if
  you need to specify any of the complex options with regular expressions in.
  
  When arguments are specified in a file, one single argument must be specified
  per line of the file. For example, "-format tomcat" must be written on two
  lines. You can include # at the start of a line for comments; blank lines
  are OK.  

Output options
--------------

-stdout
  Write output to standard output instead of to a file. This does not need
  to be specified if you specify -stdin.

-folder {folder}
  Place output files in the specified folder instead of in the same folder as
  input files.

-overwrite
  Overwrite existing output files. (Without specifying this option, if the 
  system would otherwise overwrite an existing file, it exits with an error.)
