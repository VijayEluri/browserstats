This project is in alpha state and the documentation isn't finished. Please
try it out if you are interested. You will need to build it yourself at
present.

Build
-----

To build, download it and run ant on build.xml (you may want to look at it
first to see where it will put the jar files, default is desktop).

Run
---

To run, run those jar files with 'java -jar bs.whatever.jar'; with no other
parameters, you'll get help output.

Documentation
-------------

(Required! You'll need to read this to figure out which program to run on
what...)
